### Gameplay
Three rooms are available. Walk north from the first area to reach the second
and again to reach the third. Rooms two and three contain darker zones where
random encounters may happen. The encounter rate defaults to 40% but can be
tweaked via the `ENCOUNTER_RATE` constant in `main.py`.

When an encounter occurs the screen fades to a simple battle screen. The
interface shows the player and enemy HP along with a menu containing **Fight**,
**Bag**, **Switch**, and **Run**. Enemies display their level next to their name.
After victory you earn experience and coins based on enemy level. Coins can be
spent at the shop in the starting area (press `Space` while standing on the
yellow square). The Bag screen lets you equip swords or drink health potions.
Items stack up to five in a slot.

### Leveling

point. After each level up a screen will prompt you to raise either Strength,
Defense, or Speed.
